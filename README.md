# geometry_poc
This is a poc for using polygons to assert if a point is in a certain area.

The main packages here are: fastkml and shapely. pyproj is only used here to convert the coordinates to UTM.

## The tests
The tests use a custom kml with a polygon of Haifa sea, you can load the kml into [google earth](https://earth.google.com/web/) to see the polygon.
